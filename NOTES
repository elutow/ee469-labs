TODO:

- (Pipelining issue) Register values for immediate register read after register write

From Slack channel (Han Yang Du):

Anyway if youre attempting to view the block ram pass through the build log you wanna look for 30.24. Executing MEMORY_BRAM pass (mapping $mem cells to block memories). in the yosys build log and then you'll see a line that goes Processing top.the_cpu.data_mem.mem: with data_mem and mem being whatever you called your stuff. If it mapped successfully, it'll eventually output something like
Creating $__ICE40_RAM4K_M0 cell at grid position <0 0 0>: the_cpu.data_mem.mem.0.0.0
Creating $__ICE40_RAM4K_M0 cell at grid position <1 0 0>: the_cpu.data_mem.mem.1.0.0
If it failed, it'll output
No acceptable bram resources found.
For me, a byte addressable big endian memory system reg [7:0] mem [0:???] couldnt map to bram but a word addressable memory reg [31:0] mem [0:???] worked fine

Modules shared between modules:
- regfile

Cycles with modules:

=== Cycle 0 ===

fetcher
- Fetch instruction

=== Cycle 1 ===

decoder
- Read regfile

=== Cycle 2 ===

executor
- Executes the instruction
- Access data memory (load or store). This serves the function of the memory access stage

=== Cycle 3 ===

writeback
- Write back to regfile
