TODO:

Pipelining: Implement bubbles/no-ops and bypasses
- See Wikipedia for full list of hazards: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(computer_architecture)
- Also see this lecture: https://www3.nd.edu/~mniemier/teaching/2011_B_Fall/lectures/14_PPT_1up.pdf
- Implement end of MEM -> beginning of EXE data forwarding (see above slides)
- Implement regfilewriter write -> decoder regfile read forwarding (see above lecture slides). Should implement it in regfile module
- Implementing bubbles for LDR hazard:
    - Add input signal to regfilewriter so that PC updating can be temporarily disabled
    - Add output signal to add bubble in pipeline from executor whenever operand of instruction uses result of prior LDR instruction
    - Add control logic to disable executor
        - When combined with disabling PC update, this will effectively add bubble to pipeline by "freezing" its contents

Modules shared between modules:
- regfile

Cycles with modules:

=== Cycle 0 ===

fetcher: Fetch instruction

=== Cycle 1 ===

decoder: Read regfile

=== Cycle 2 ===

executor: Executes the instruction

=== Cycle 3 ===

memaccessor: Reads and writes from data memory
- For STR: Read existing values during this cycle

=== Cycle 4 ===

regfilewriter: Write back to regfile
memaccessor
- For STR: Actually perform the write
